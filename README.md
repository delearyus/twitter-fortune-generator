# twitter-fortune-generator
Generates linux fortune files from tweets

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

this program will not work on its own due to the nature of the twitter API.  It
requires an additional file, `account_keys.py`, which contains string values
`access_token` and `access_secret`.  These keys can be obtained from twitter
